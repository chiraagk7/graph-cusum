Graph topology change-point detection using graph signals. 

See [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11345) for details on the methods used.

#### Experiments

1. Node Centrality Change: Detect a change from an Erdős–Rényi graph to a Barabási–Albert graph
2. Emerging Community: Detect an emerging community on an underlying Erdős–Rényi graph
3. Twitter Mentions: Detect change-points in Twitter mentions of large, publicly-traded companies
